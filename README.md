### âœ… Cucumber.js Git PoC

This project is a minimal Proof of Concept using **Cucumber.js** to explore Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with automated tests.
It includes:

* A simple feature file written in **Gherkin syntax**
* Step definitions implemented in JavaScript
* A working test scenario (addition example)
* A GitHub Actions CI workflow that automatically runs Cucumber on each push or pull request

The goal is to quickly get hands-on with Cucumber, experiment with BDD structure, and showcase test automation in a version-controlled setup.
